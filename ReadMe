After a horrible experience I needed a better way to manage my passwords.  I didn't want to use the one
provided by google because I am unsure if I will be using their browser 10,20 or 30 years from now.  This aims 
to solve these issue.

The design is straight foward. It will be a command line tool where you can fetch, list, add, and change passwords.
The database is gob(binary) encoded array of passwords with some metadata. The database is then encrypted and decrypted 
using AES-256 in GCM mode.  It is the users responsibilty to encrypt the file. Once encrypted a copy can be store in multiple
places. A local server, disk, usb or whatever you like!
